LUTIL
*****
A tiny library for getting embedded work done faster. Many of the modern libraries are bulky and come with a ton of options but under the caveat of bloat. ``LUTIL`` is designed to be a simple, straight forward API, to let developers using common STL-like tools without needing the STL suit.

Tested on the Teensy, UNO, NANO, and other such processors, the library is far reaching.
